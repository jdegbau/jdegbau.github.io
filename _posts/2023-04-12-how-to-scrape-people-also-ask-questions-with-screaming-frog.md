## Configuring Screaming Frog

Let's start by setting up our Screaming Frog configuration to work around a few quirks. Follow these steps to tweak the basic settings:

> Want to skip the set up? You can download [my Screaming Frog configuration here](/assets/other/PAA Scraper.seospiderconfig).

1. Under **Configuration > robots.txt > Settings**, change the dropdown to "Ignore robots.txt."
2. Under **Configuration > Speed**, change "Max Threads" to 1 (this is technically optional, but it should help prevent running into CAPTCHA errors for larger lists).
3. Under **Configuration > User-Agent**, change "Pre-set User-Agents" to one of the standard browser user-agents. We recommend Chrome.

Once you've made these changes, we can proceed to the tricky part—using Screaming Frog's "Extraction" function. Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Configuration > Custom > Extraction**. You'll see a modal that looks like this:
2. In the first box, you can name it whatever you want, but we'll go with "PAA Question" for this example.
3. Change the next dropdown to CSSPath (meaning we're looking for a specific element as if we were styling it with CSS). In the box now labeled "Enter CSS Path," enter the following snippet: `.related-question-pair`.
4. Change the next dropdown to "Extract Text" and then hit OK.

Screaming Frog is now configured to scrape PAAs. Next, we need to give it a list.

*Pro Tip: Plan to do this often? Remember that you can always save the configuration settings and easily load them again later!*

## Assembling Your URL List

In order to scrape PAAs at scale, we'll need a list of URLs for the SERPs those PAAs live on. The good news is: it's very easy to predict what those URLs will be!

You're looking at crawling URLs that look like this:

`https://www.google.com/search?q=best+dog+food`


All you have to do is replace the bit after `?q=` with whatever keyword you want. If you have even a basic knowledge of Google Sheets or Excel, follow these steps:

1. Configure a spreadsheet where column A is your list of keywords—one per row.
2. Enter this formula in column B: `="https://www.google.com/search?q="&A2`.
3. Fill that formula down the rest of the rows.

You've now got your list of URLs to crawl in Screaming Frog.

## Actually Scraping the PAAs

1. Put Screaming Frog into list mode, paste the URLs, and hit "Start."
2. As Screaming Frog does its thing, you should start to see data piling into the "Custom Extraction" report.

Admittedly, the format here is a bit wonky—each PAA on a page will receive its own column. Still, you should be able to export this into a spreadsheet and clean it up fairly easily.

And that's it! You should now have a nice, healthy list of People Also Ask questions for analysis!

## Potential Pitfalls

This method works for us at the time of writing, but it can be a bit fragile. If it's not working for you, here are a few potential things to think about:

- Google changes the underlying code of its SERPs with some regularity. The `.related-question-pair` selector works for now, but it may change in the future.
- Crawling SERPs this way too frequently or too quickly can result in Google showing you a CAPTCHA challenge. If this happens, it will prevent Screaming Frog from capturing the PAAs on those questions.
- This is admittedly NOT the best solution. There are tools out there that can do this at scale, but this is a fun use of Screaming Frog and great if you’re just looking for some quick and dirty content ideas for keywords you already have available.
